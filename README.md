# Tel-Aviv-Apartments-Data-Scraping
This project scrapes real estate listing data for apartments in Tel Aviv, including features, prices, and addresses. It integrates the Google Distance Matrix API to calculate the distance of each apartment from Dizengoff Square. The data is processed to handle missing values and structured for further analysis.
